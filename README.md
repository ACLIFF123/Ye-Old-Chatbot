Ye Old Chatbot

Objectives:

    Build a chatbot using Python and pre-trained models
    Explore parameters and configurations for model behaviour
    Implement a simple user interface for interaction
    Explain the role of a system prompt in guiding chatbot responses
    Experiment with fine-tuning and custom prompts to guide chatbot behaviour

Overview:

Summary:
    I am going to build my own chatbot interface using a real pretrained LLM. Then, I and potentially you will retrain it to speak like a character from a Shakespearean tavern.
